* Hierarchical coherence
* Grouped coherence
* Graph coherence
* Disjoint graphs (cross-validation, incomplete reconciliation)
* Pruning the graph / tree
* Unbalanced trees
* Code in fable (multiple roots and disjoint children)
* Data exploration with graphs
* Forecast reconciliation on graphs

### Format

15-20 minute talk with some questions.
